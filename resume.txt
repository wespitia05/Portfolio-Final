What Makes Me Stand Out:
    - I'm a team player, I take accountability, responsibility and pride for my work, I'm a hard worker and stay true to myself, I get along with others.
Weaknesses:
    - Biggest weakness is I have OCD, which can be a strength in a way mainly because I take more time to keep everything organized and readable/understandable for others.
    - I'd rather take more time on a project to deliver a better product then to rush a project and deliver an ok project.
